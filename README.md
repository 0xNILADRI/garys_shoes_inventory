# Gary's Shoes Inventory Management

Gary's Shoes is a US based company that has been established 30 years ago. Currently it operates at US , Canada, UK and Germany. The firm sells mid to high end shoes ranging from 120 - 200 dollars. The problem their store faces is that there are lots and lots of inventory that are never sold.

That is where we come in, in order to determine the right amount of shoes to be stocked at stores, we have to perform statistical analysis in order to find the right answer, which meets the stores demands. 

Our approach would be to find the confidence intervals for the amount of shoes for each store.
